# QAC_Challenges

## Challenge 1
[Link to code](Challenges/julydevops.py)

Task:\
Write a python script with the above name which does the following:
* initialises a list which contains the FIRST NAME of all 21 people in this cohort
*	using the .append() function add me to the list
*	print the 5th person in the list (this is a trick question, what is special about the way Python indexes?)
*	print the number of Chris in the cohort

## Challenge 2
[Link to code](Challenges/times.py)

Task:\
Given an integer n, write a python function which returns a times table grid for all the integers between 1 and n.\
The grid should be separated by tabs and new lines

## Challenge 3
[Link to code](Challenges/test_string.py)

Task:\
I have a function called string_gen() that will return a random 5-character-long string of lowercase letters. Write some tests for this function.\ 
To reiterate, the output should always be:
* a string
*	5 characters long
*	comprised of lowercase letters

## Challenge 4
[Link to class code](Challenges/21072020/rectangle.py)\
[Link to test code](Challenges/21072020/test_rectangle.py)

Task:\
Define a class named Rectangle, which can be constructed by a length and width.\
The Rectangle class needs to have a method that can compute area.\
Finally, write a unit test to test this method.

## Challenge 5
[Link to function code](Challenges/22072020/alpha_words.py)
[Link to test code](Challenges/22072020/test_alpha.py)

Task:\
Write a function that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as a string input, sorts each item alphanumerically and removes any duplicate items, then returns the result as a string. Write a test for this function.\
For example:
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again\
Then, the output should be: again and hello makes perfect practice world

## Challenge 6
[Link to function code](Challenges/23072020/addition.py)
[Link to test code](Challenges/23072020/test_addition.py)

Task:\
Write a function that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.\
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 9 Then, the output should be: 11106 (i.e. 9+99+999+9999)\
Write a test for this function.
