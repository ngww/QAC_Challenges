Write a python script with the above name which does the following:
* initialises a list which contains the FIRST NAME of all 21 people in this cohort
*	using the .append() function add me to the list
*	print the 5th person in the list (this is a trick question, what is special about the way Python indexes?)

## Challenge 2
[Link to code](Challenges/times.py)

Task:\
Given an integer n, write a python function which returns a times table grid for all the integers between 1 and n.\
The grid should be separated by tabs and new lines

## Challenge 3
[Link to code](Challenges/test_string.py)

Task:\
I have a function called string_gen() that will return a random 5-character-long string of lowercase letters. Write some tests for this function.\ 
To reiterate, the output should always be:
* a string
*	5 characters long
*	comprised of lowercase letters

## Challenge 4
[Link to class code](Challenges/21072020/rectangle.py)\
[Link to test code](Challenges/21072020/test_rectangle.py)

Task:\
Define a class named Rectangle, which can be constructed by a length and width.\
The Rectangle class needs to have a method that can compute area.\
Finally, write a unit test to test this method.
